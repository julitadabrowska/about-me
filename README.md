# README 
Hi everyone, I am a Product Manager striving to understand my engineering teams best. For this purpose I'm learning Golang which I find frustrating but super rewarding. Forgive my spaghetti code!

I've been working with software development teams for 9 years now, with 4.5 years focusing on the fintech vertical. I specialize in core services and databases, occasionally programming in Golang.

I have been building software products throughout the whole software development lifecycle, from problem definition to execution and proper UAT testing.
I love working with dev teams and customers - always being in the middle between business and technology. I always need to understand what my devs are talking about, so you'll see me attending their meetings, spearheading discussions about technical approaches and pairing with engineers on writing PRDs.
From the business perspective, I'm always making sure that we reach business goals via providing value to the customers.

I love using data to back our decisions, whether it's the performance of our service, costs, customer drop-offs, incidents in our APIs, or team velocity. You will always see me asking WHY we are doing something, and thinking twice if we understand the root problem first, before proposing solutions. Talking to the customers is really my thing, always digging deeper on what the real pain point is and empathizing with them.

My biggest weakness is getting attached to people - if I meet a great, professional team that cares about the product, I will acknowledge it as my new home, regardless of the industry. I love sparking curiosity in people, discovering things together, helping whoever is stuck, and asking for help if I need it. Where possible, I will always simplify things so that people don't have to spend too much time seeing unnecessary details. That's why you will often see me drawing flows, graphs, and mockups - because a picture conveys more than a thousand words.

I'm not a fan of putting pressure on dev teams; I believe that as long as the teams are well informed, empowered, and unblocked, the work will go forward at a good pace. But I'm also not backing wasting time in any form - if we can do something async, let's do it.
I am most experienced in the Fintech industry, especially Payments. Over the years, I have successfully led cross-functional teams to develop and launch Fintech products - both in the realm of B2C apps as well as B2B cloud-native services for Tier 1 banks. I've been working with databases and data solutions, making sure that we use the right tools for our use-cases and provide proper performance but don't waste resources. And I really mean it - at Form3, I spearheaded initiatives that led us to saving over $100K annually on data storage.

And at the end - I'm only human like all of us. I know that one can reach excellence in their job, but I also know that I will make mistakes and I have a universe of learning ahead of me.

If this is your vibe, drop me a line. I'm always curious to meet new people, learn new things, and perhaps give back to the community by sharing something I know. And most importantly, every new person I meet is the whole new story!
