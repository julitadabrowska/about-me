# README 
Hi everyone, I am a Product Manager striving to understand my engineering teams best. For this purpose I'm learning Golang which I find frustrating but super rewarding. Forgive my spaghetti code!

I strongly believe in value-driven development so you will see me always asking WHY are we doing something and trying to always verify if our activities contribute to our goals. I love working with talented people - I believe that motivated, skilled and professional team can do amazing things.
